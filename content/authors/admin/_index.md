I obtained my diploma of engineering in agronomy at [Agrocampus Ouest](https://www.agrocampus-ouest.fr/) together with an MSc in Biochemistry and Genetics applied to Animal Science from Univ. Rennes II in 2000. Then, I worked on transcriptional regulations by the nuclear receptors PPARalpha and RXR at INRA Pharmacology and Toxicology research unit (supervisor T. Pineau) and obtained my PhD in biology in 2007 at Toulouse III University.    

I was appointed as a research engineer at [INRA](http://www.inra.fr/en) during my PhD (2004) and co-directed the group of [Integrative Toxicology & Metabolism](https://www.toulouse.inra.fr/toxalim/Equipes-Recherche-Publications/E1-TIM-Toxicologie-Integrative-Metabolisme) for 4 years (2008-2011). Next, I created the [GeT-TriX](https://www.toulouse.inra.fr/toxalim/Plateformes-Technologiques/E23-TRiX) transcriptomic facility at INRA [ToxAlim](https://www.toulouse.inra.fr/toxalim) (2011-2013). During these years, I led significant research projects that contributed to the development of ToxAlim.  

In 2013-2015, I joined the group of Olivier Cuvier at the [Center for Integrative Biology](http://cbi-toulouse.fr/eng/), where I studied chromatin organization and transcription in _Drosophila_ cells using various genome-wide approaches based on NGS.  

In 2015-2017 I was awarded an [Agreenskills+](https://www.agreenskills.eu) fellowship, and joined the group of Scott Michaels at Indiana University [Department of Biology](https://biology.indiana.edu/) to decipher the role of a new family of negative transcription elongation factors on RNA polymerase II processivity, chromatin organization and gene expression.  

In 2017-2019, back at INRA Toxalim, I joined the [BioToMyc](https://www6.toulouse.inrae.fr/toxalim/Equipes-Recherche-Publications/BioToMyc-Biosynthese-Toxicite-des-Mycotoxines) group of Isabelle Oswald where I initiated a project aimed at elucidating the role played by transcription elongation factors on the regulation of gene clusters involve in the synthesis of mycotoxins.

In 2019-2020, I joined the [lab of Pr Craig Pikaard](https://pikweb.sitehost.iu.edu/) at Indiana University where I worked on long read sequencing to assemble the ribosomal DNA regions of the genome of _Arabidopsis thaliana_. 

Throughout my career, I have balanced biology with bioinformatics and biostatistics and gained experience in the production and analysis of different types of high throughput data.
