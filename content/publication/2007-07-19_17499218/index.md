# Abstract:
abstract: "Fumonisin B(1) (FB(1)) is a mycotoxin produced by Fusarium verticillioides, the cause of Fusarium kernel rot in maize. FB(1) is toxic in domestic and laboratory animals, including pigs. This study investigated the effects of a seven-days-exposure of 1.5mg/kg b.w. FB(1) on the porcine intestinal epithelium. Statistically significant increases in the ratio of sphinganine to sphingosine, as well as alterations of the glycolipid distribution were observed in the jejunum. Using a porcine intestinal epithelial cell line (IPEC-1) derived from jejunum and ileum, we tested the effect of FB(1)in vitro in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. A significant increase in sphinganine concentration was observed after 2 days of FB(1) exposure at concentrations >100 microM, or from 6 days of FB(1) exposure at concentration >20 microM. We were also able to show that FB(1) exposure at 200 microM during 16 days increased the intestinal trans-epithelial flux of FB(1). These data indicate that, in pigs, this mycotoxin acts selectively on jejunum cells as follows: (i) FB(1) affects sphingolipid metabolism, as demonstrated by an increase of the amount of free sphingoid bases in a time- and dose-dependent manner, (ii) a depletion of the glycolipids in plasma membranes is observed, and (iii) an increase occurs in the trans-epithelial flux."
