# Abstract:
abstract: "De novo fatty acid biosynthesis is also called lipogenesis. It is a metabolic pathway that provides the cells with fatty acids required for major cellular processes such as energy storage, membrane structures and lipid signaling. In this article we will review the role of the Liver X Receptors (LXRs), nuclear receptors that sense oxysterols, in the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in lipogenesis."
