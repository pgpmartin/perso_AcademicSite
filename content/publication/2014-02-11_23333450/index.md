# Abstract:
abstract: "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nutrients influence non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Essential fatty acids deficiency promotes various syndromes, including hepatic steatosis, through increased de novo lipogenesis. The mechanisms underlying such increased lipogenic response remain unidentified. METHODS: We used wild type mice and mice lacking Liver X Receptors to perform a nutrigenomic study that aimed at examining the role of these transcription factors. RESULTS: We showed that, in the absence of Liver X Receptors, essential fatty acids deficiency does not promote steatosis. Consistent with this, Liver X Receptors are required for the elevated expression of genes involved in lipogenesis in response to essential fatty acids deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: This work identifies, for the first time, the central role of Liver X Receptors in steatosis induced by essential fatty acids deficiency."
