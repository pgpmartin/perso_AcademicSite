# Abstract:
abstract: "Endoreduplication, during which cells increase their DNA content through successive rounds of full genome replication without cell division, is the major source of endopolyploidy in higher plants. Endoreduplication plays pivotal roles in plant growth and development and is associated with the activation of specific transcriptional programmes that are characteristic of each cell type, thereby defining their identity. In plants, endoreduplication is found in numerous organs and cell types, especially in agronomically valuable ones, such as the fleshy fruit (pericarp) of tomato presenting high ploidy levels. We used the tomato pericarp tissue as a model system to explore the transcriptomes associated with endoreduplication progression during fruit growth. We confirmed that expression globally scales with ploidy level and identified sets of differentially expressed genes presenting only developmental-specific, only ploidy-specific expression patterns or profiles resulting from an additive effect of ploidy and development. When comparing ploidy levels at a specific developmental stage, we found that non-endoreduplicated cells are defined by cell division state and cuticle synthesis while endoreduplicated cells are mainly defined by their metabolic activity changing rapidly over time. By combining this dataset with publicly available spatiotemporal pericarp expression data, we proposed a map describing the distribution of ploidy levels within the pericarp. These transcriptome-based predictions were validated by quantifying ploidy levels within the pericarp tissue. This in situ ploidy quantification revealed the dynamic progression of endoreduplication and its cell layer specificity during early fruit development. In summary, the study sheds light on the complex relationship between endoreduplication, cell differentiation and gene expression patterns in the tomato pericarp."
